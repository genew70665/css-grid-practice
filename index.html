                <p class= "answer">We were building a new house, and I wanted to buy a glass panel for the house. The panel costs over $3000. I thought I can make my own much cheaper. I started looking for a class to learn </p>

                <br> 
                <p class="answer">I found a class at McNeese Univeristy. The class was taught by Frank Thompson. Franks Thompson built houses, and he would give one of his panels with each house. Unfortunately, Frank Thompson passed away earlier this year.
